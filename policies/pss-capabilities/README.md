# Description
This Validating Admission Policy ensures that containers drop the 'ALL' capability (i.e. removing all capabilities), and can then only add back the 'NET_BIND_SERVICE' capability (if desired).
This policy is part of the Pod Security Standards provided by Kubernetes, found here - https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted.

# Parameter used by the policy
This policy evaluates securityContext.capabilities.drop[] and securityContext.capabilities.add[] within spec.containers[*], spec.initContainers[*] and spec.ephemeralContainers[*]. For the API call to be accepted then for each and every container: securityContext.capabilities.drop[] must be specified and include 'ALL', and securityContext.capabilities.add[] can only include 'NET_BIND_SERVICE' (or be unspecified).

# Example parameter
